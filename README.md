# Godot_RigidBodyFpsController
Idea started from Unity DaniTutorials @DaniDevy Rigidbody FPS controller.

RigidBody is the only option when is needed the interaction between physics bodies or use of Joints.    
Right now it's pretty basic and I had problems with floor detection being inconsistent. It can be worked around using Area or Raycast.
